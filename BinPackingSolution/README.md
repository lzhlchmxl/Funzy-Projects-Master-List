# Bin Packing Solution [School Project]

## Introduction
   - Bin Packing Solution is a solution to the [Bin-Packing Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) implemented with Java.
   - This is a small project done in my **fourth year** into coding, it only has a  **command line UI**.
   - Noticible skils involved: *Java, Algorithm Design, Algorithm Analysis*
   
## Installation
   - Download or clone the repo
   - Open terminal and compile the three java files, make sure they are in the same directory.
   - Run “Java Main” and follow the program’s instructions to enter the necessary parameters.
   - The results will be displayed in the terminal.
   
## Bin Packing Problem
In the bin packing problem, objects of different volumes must be packed into a finite number of bins in a way that minimizes the number of bins used. In computational complexity theory, it is a combinatorial NP-hard problem.


## Tutorial
- Enter the number of objects that are going to be put into bins
- Enter an array of integers representing the size of each object
- Enter an integer to indicate the size of the bin (volume V).
