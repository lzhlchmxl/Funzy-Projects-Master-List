# [MUSIED](http://musied.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) [Personal Project][Early Prototype]

## Introduction
   - The link to MUSIED is an early prototype on AWS. **The actual project at musied.ca has been taken down and is no longer being maintained.**
   - [MUSIED](http://musied.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) is an online self-learning platform for adults.
   - MUSIED is my first front-end development attempt in my **first year** into coding.
   - Noticible skils involved: *HTML/CSS, PHP, Web Design*

## Background
   - The project is the technical part of one of my earlier business ventures. The goal is to connect music instrument self-learners and music professionals together via a mobile/web app. The learner can use laptops/mobile devices to take a short video clip of their instrument playing and uploads to musied. The music professionals will review the video clips and give feedback. 
   - Instead of taking an online lesson, MUSIED give you even more freedom and is at a much cheaper cost. MUSIED is designed for self-learners.
   - The coding of the project is simple but very poorly written. Alot of the elements are not aligned properly and the responsivness is low.
