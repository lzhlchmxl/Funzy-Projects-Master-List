# Sky Ranger [School Project]

## Introduction
   - Sky Ranger is a si-fi 2D top-down first person shooter game with original story and design.
   - The project is developed using [Game Maker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) written in a Java-like object oriented language.
   - The project was an ambitious attempt in my **second year** into coding, it was extremely fun but due to time limitations **only the tutorial level** was completed.
   - The source code of the project was very unfortunetly lost.
   - Noticible skils involved: *Java-like Object Oriented Language, Audio Effects, Photoshop, Game Design.*

However, the wormholes are the most dangerous places in the universe...You have to calculate your jumps carefully and make decisions wisely... 


## Tutorial
