# Sky Ranger [School Project]

## Introduction
   - Sky Ranger is a si-fi 2D top-down first person shooter game with original story and design.
   - The project is developed using [Game Maker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) written in a Java-like object oriented language.
   - The project was an ambitious attempt in my **second year** into coding, it was extremely fun but due to time limitations **only the tutorial level** was completed.
   - The source code of the project was very unfortunetly lost.
   - Noticible skils involved: *Java-like Object Oriented Language, Audio Effects, Photoshop, Game Design.*

## Story
Sky Rangers are earth's last defense formed with genetically modifed elite soldiers. Sky Rangers deploy at a globle range to counter world level disasters, let it be alien invasion...zombies...anciant portals...


## Tutorial 
- Use AWSD to move around, left click to shoot, '1, 2' to switch between weapons.
- The tutorial is actually the hardest level in the game, you are meant to die quickly and then discover it was a training session.
- It is unfortunete that only the tutorial level was completed.
